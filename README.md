## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites before setting up the project:

- Python 3.x
- [Additional dependencies...]

### Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MDMohaymenUlAnam/Basic-Analysis-Of-Thesis.git
cd Basic-Analysis-Of-Thesis
# Additional setup commands...
```

## Usage

### PocketGuard CSV

The PocketGuard CSV is a vital component of this analysis. It serves as the dataset for the thesis analysis. Before running the analysis, download the dataset from [this link](link-to-pocketguard-csv) and place it in the `data` directory of the project.

### ROS Augmentation

This project applies Random Over-Sampling (ROS) Augmentation to handle imbalanced datasets. The augmentation process is an integral part of the analysis and is automatically executed during the analysis run.

### Classification Models

The analysis employs 5 classification models to process and understand the data. To utilize these models, follow the examples below:
