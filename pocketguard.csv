Reached out to customer service and they told me I didn’t use the right bank password (and that I should “copy and paste”) as if I’m an idiot.

I tried uninstalling and re-installing the app but I’m still getting the same problem. I also made sure it’s completely up to date...

"What attracted me to this app was that it would tell you how much money you have left over after all your expenses were paid. I had hoped this would be the one and only budgeting app I would ever need. 
Well where do I start? First off, while it automatically updates my chase bank info, it doesn’t automatically update my Navy FCU. I have request a code, then wait for this app to let me enter the code which takes at least a minute. Once it has the code then it takes about 20 seconds or more to update. All other apps continue to sync whereas PocketGuard gets amnesia. This is a big fail which the company really needs to work on. 
The second issue I have is the app predicting how much and when my next paycheck will be. I get paid by the law firm on the 15th and 30th of every month but if the day falls on a weekend then I’m paid on the Friday or Monday. You can’t program the app to adjust for this. Second, hours paid changes depending how many days are in a month. I.E. 30 vs 31st vs 28. While my hours are consistent, the payout varies according to the calendar. Simply put, some pay periods have one extra day or less a day or even. This app doesn’t account for those variations or allow to to program that algorithm. 
In comparison to Mint, Experian, NerdWallet, and WalletHub, PocketGuard ranks in the bottom of my list.

"Helpful, but could be improved. 1) bills/expenses on the last day of the month often don't show up in ""upcoming bills"", I'm assuming because there's 28, 30, or 31 days in the month. The solution to this is upgrading to plus and adding it in as a cash bill. 2) would be great to be able to split a single purchase between two or more categories for more accurate data. So if you buy a card and gift while grocery shopping, you could categorize appropriately instead of adding it in as a note on the purchase. 3) rolling over income and bills into the next month. Everything is month-based in this app, but a lot of people probably have bills/expenses that occur on the 1st day of the month. But these bills aren't shown or calculated in ""upcoming bills"". 4) would be nice to have a calendar view of bills and income for people that don't like lists. Overall, a very helpful app. These are just suggestions to improve that I've noticed after using this app for multiple months.

"The pro here is the beautiful UI. I wish I could use this app. Unfortunately, it's hardly viable because of all the weird glitches. It took a LOT of work to get my accounts to link successfully.

Annoying, but you only have to set it up once. Now that I'm in the app and linked up properly, though, it's just getting a bunch of transaction names wrong.

In fact, the ONLY reason I would pay to use this app from month to month or annually is if it included a feature to EXPORT reports of my expenses based on the categories that I chose.
